## Subject

You have just been recruited into a team of developers and have been given a 10 000 line C++ code file. Your task is to clean and organize it into a proper project.
You will write a markdown checklist called `checklist.md` to help you clean up the project. Create this file in `PS7/` using what you have learned in this course. It is important to be precise but concise!
The goal is to produce a file that you can reuse for other projects (at least the points that are not specific to C++).
