:class: dropdown
Another session in the terminal!
:::

:::{important} `.gitignore`
We will create `makefile` files without an extension. Add `!makefile` to `.gitignore` to avoid ignoring them while continuing to exclude executable files.
Additionally, we will generate the directories `build/` and `docs/`, which will contain compilation files and documentation that we will ignore.

## Exercise 1: Makefile

Here is a minimal example of a C++ project:
```{code} md
minimal-project/
    hello.h
    hello.cpp
    main.cpp
    makefile
```

:::{important} Build systems
Instead of manually compiling and executing each project, as projects become more complex, they require a **build system** based on **build scripts**.

A **build script** is a file that automates the compilation process and dependency management of a project. It defines the necessary steps to build the project, such as compiling source code, assembling files, generating documentation, or running tests. Its purpose is to simplify, standardize, and accelerate the project build process.

The standard **build systems** in C++ are **CMake** and **Makefile**. Other languages use their own tools, such as **MSBuild** for C# or **Gradle** and **Maven** for Java. Some IDEs also integrate their own build systems. For example, a Java project in Eclipse uses Eclipse's native build system.

In this session, we will explore the operation of a build system through a **Makefile** build script, a low-level build system for C/C++ designed for Unix systems (Linux and macOS). **CMake** is more high-level and **cross-platform** (compatible with other systems like Windows), but we will focus on **Makefile**, which provides better low-level control.

:::{warning} Linux on Windows
:class: dropdown
If you are using Windows at the IUT, you can try using **Git Bash** and hope that the necessary installations are available. If that does not work, use Linux (Debian distribution at the IUT)...
If you are using your own machine, you can install [**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to benefit from a Linux virtual machine with Ubuntu as the default distribution. However, perform these installations at home to avoid wasting time during the session.
:::

1. Create the directory and files listed above in `PS4/` with the corresponding code.

`hello.h`
```{code} cpp
#ifndef HELLO_H
#define HELLO_H

void sayHello();

#endif
```

`hello.cpp`
```{code} cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "hello.h"

void sayHello() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
```

`main.cpp`
```{code} cpp
#include "hello.h"

int main() {
    sayHello();
    return 0;
}
```

`makefile`
```{code} makefile
all: executable

executable: main.o hello.o
	g++ -o executable main.o hello.o

main.o: main.cpp
	g++ -c main.cpp

hello.o: hello.cpp
	g++ -c hello.cpp

run:
	./executable

clean:
	rm -f executable main.o hello.o

.PHONY: all run clean
```

(ps4-make-commands)=
:::{important} Makefile
A **Makefile** uses a syntax based on **targets**. In the terminal, you can execute a target with the command:
```{code} sh
make <target>
```
Here are some common examples:
- `make` executes the default **`all`** target, which compiles the program.
- `make run` runs the compiled program (the executable).
- `make clean` removes the files generated by the compilation to clean the project.

By default, `make` looks for a file named `makefile` or `Makefile` to find the targets to execute. If your build script has a different name, like `my-build-script`, you will need to specify its name with the `-f` option:
```{code} sh
make -f my-build-script <target>
```
`-f` stands for **file**, indicating a specific makefile.
:::

:::{important} Makefile syntax
The basic syntax of a target:
```{code} makefile
<target>: <first prerequisite> <second prerequisite> <...>
    <first command>
    <second command>
    <...>
```
:::

(ps4-make-behavior)=
:::{important} Behavior of `make <target>`
`make <target>` attempts to create a file with the name of the **target** by executing the associated commands.

Before building a target, `make` attempts to build its **prerequisites**. If everything is up to date, meaning that for every (target, prerequisite) pair involved in the target’s construction, the target file has been created/modified after the prerequisite file, then `make` does nothing. If the file does not exist, `make` considers it outdated.

When a target is outdated, `make` executes the commands associated with it.

For example:
```{code} makefile
target : prerequisite
    target command

prerequisite :
    prerequisite command
```
In the example above, if both `target` and `prerequisite` files exist, and the last modification of `target` was at 2:00 PM while `prerequisite` was modified at 1:59 PM, then `make` checks that `prerequisite` is up to date (which it is since it has no prerequisites itself). Then it verifies if `target` is up to date (which it is, since its last modification is more recent than `prerequisite`) and does nothing.

This behavior optimizes compilation, avoiding recompiling the entire project, which is crucial for large projects that may take hours to compile.  

**Explanation of the makefile from the example**:
- `all`: This is the **default target** executed when typing `make`. It contains no command and simply checks if `executable` is up to date.
- `executable`: This target depends on `main.o` and `hello.o`, which are **object files** generated from the project's `.cpp` files. Once these prerequisites are up to date, `make` executes `g++ -o executable main.o hello.o`, which links `main.o` and `hello.o` to create the `executable` binary (Linking, the final step of C++ compilation).
- `main.o` and `hello.o`:
  - `main.o` depends on `main.cpp`. Even though `main.cpp` is not an explicit target, `make` simply checks if the file exists and is up to date.
  - To generate `main.o`, `make` executes `g++ -c main.cpp`. This runs the **preprocessor**, generates the **translation unit**, and compiles the code into an **object file** `.o`.
  - The same logic applies to `hello.o`.
- `run`: Assumes the program is already compiled and simply executes `./executable`.
- `clean`:
  - Has no prerequisites.
  - Deletes generated files using `rm -f executable main.o hello.o`.
  - The `-f` (**force**) option removes files without confirmation and without errors if the files do not exist. This option is commonly used for `clean` in makefiles.
:::

:::{important} `.PHONY`
You may have noticed that some targets (`all`, `run`, `clean`) do not correspond to files, and the associated commands do not generate files or directories with these names.

Since these files do not exist, `make` always considers these targets as outdated and executes them systematically, which is the intended behavior for `all`, `run`, and `clean`.

**Potential issue:**
If the project contains files named `all`, `run`, or `clean`, `make` might interpret them as up-to-date files and not execute the associated commands.

**Solution: `.PHONY` targets**
To prevent this confusion, we declare these targets as **phony** using the directive `.PHONY: all run clean`.
This tells `make` that `all`, `run`, and `clean` are not files but commands to execute systematically, even if files with these names exist.
:::

:::{important} Why separate compilation into multiple steps?
We are used to compiling in a single step without generating intermediate files like `.o` files. Why not do the same here?

In a growing project, different parts of the code that make up the final executable(s) arrive gradually. It is essential to be able to compile and test certain parts of the code without waiting for the entire project to be completed.
Even if all files are present, modifying a single part of the code does not mean we need to recompile everything. For large projects, where compilation can take minutes (or even hours), avoiding full recompilation saves a significant amount of time.

Thus, splitting compilation into multiple steps (generating `.o` files for each `.cpp` file, then final linking) is a good practice for evolving and large projects.
:::

2. Run `make`, `make run`, and `make clean`, and observe their effects in the terminal and on the files.

:::{warning} Error: missing separator  
:class: dropdown  
If you encounter the "missing separator" error when running `make`, it is possible that copying and pasting the makefile content into your editor replaced tab characters with spaces. Make sure that each command line in the makefile is preceded by a tab (`Tab` instead of four spaces).  
:::

:::{important} Hidden prerequisites
In the previous makefile, there are implicit prerequisites, which are the `.h` header files. For example, `main.cpp` and `hello.cpp` depend on `hello.h`, but this prerequisite is not specified in the makefile. This does not cause issues during compilation because `g++`, thanks to the `#include` directives, understands that it must include the appropriate headers during the translation of the `.cpp` source code.

A problem can arise when a header is modified, and we want to recompile only part of the project instead of recompiling everything. Since headers are not explicitly listed as prerequisites, if all other files exist and their modification date does not indicate any changes, `make` would not recompile the project. Therefore, it is necessary to add these prerequisites to the makefile, even if they do not appear in the compilation commands.
:::

:::{important} `touch <file>` and `make -d`
To better understand the behavior of `make`, you can modify the modification date of existing files using the `touch <file>` command. If `<file>` does not exist, `touch` creates it; if it already exists, `touch` simply updates its last modification date.

Then, the `make -d` command displays all the steps of the `make` process in the terminal. However, this command generates a lot of details that are not necessarily relevant. To see only the information that interests us, you can use the following command:
```{code} sh
make -d | grep -E 'Considering|Entering|Leaving|Finished|Prerequisite|No need|up to date'
```
`grep -E '<regular expression>'` allows you to retrieve only the lines that match the given regular expression. In this case, we are looking for all lines containing the specified keywords.
:::

3. Make the following modifications to the makefile:
```{code} makefile
all: executable

executable: main.o hello.o
    g++ -o executable main.o hello.o

main.o: main.cpp hello.h
    g++ -c main.cpp

hello.o: hello.cpp hello.h
    g++ -c hello.cpp

run:
    ./executable

clean:
    rm -f executable main.o hello.o

.PHONY: all run clean
```

4. Run `make`, `make run`, and `make clean` again. The behavior of these commands should not change.

5. Make the following modifications to the makefile:
```{code} makefile
all: executable

executable: main.o hello.o
    g++ -o executable main.o hello.o

main.o: main.cpp
    g++ -c main.cpp -MMD

hello.o: hello.cpp
    g++ -c hello.cpp -MMD

run:
    ./executable

clean:
    rm -f executable main.o hello.o main.d hello.d

.PHONY: all run clean

-include *.d
```

6. Run `make` and examine the content of the generated `.d` files.

:::{important} `.d` files (dependencies)  
To avoid manually specifying headers for each source file compilation, we automatically generate `.d` dependency files using the `-MMD` option (which includes prerequisites with the headers we created, but not those from stable C++ libraries) and instruct `make` to include these prerequisites with the `-include *.d` option.  

Due to the order of execution, generating `main.d`, for example, occurs after the prerequisites for `main.o` have been processed. This is not a problem because the purpose of adding headers as prerequisites is to prevent recompiling the entire project once it has already been compiled. The first compilation will generate these dependencies, and in subsequent compilations, the `.d` files will be included, allowing `make` to detect changes in the headers.
:::

7. Make the following modifications to the makefile:
```{code} makefile
all: build build/binaries/executable

build:
    mkdir -p build/dependencies build/objects build/binaries

build/binaries/executable: build/objects/main.o build/objects/hello.o
    g++ -o build/binaries/executable build/objects/main.o build/objects/hello.o

build/objects/main.o: main.cpp
    g++ -c main.cpp -o build/objects/main.o -MMD -MF build/dependencies/main.d  

build/objects/hello.o: hello.cpp
    g++ -c hello.cpp -o build/objects/hello.o -MMD -MF build/dependencies/hello.d  

run:
    ./build/binaries/executable

clean:
    rm -rf build

.PHONY: all run clean

-include build/dependencies/*.d
```

(ps4-build-directory)=
:::{important} `build/` Directory
To avoid mixing compilation files with source code, we generate them in a directory named `build` and organize them into subdirectories: `dependencies/` for `.d` files, `objects/` for `.o` files, and `binaries/` for executables.  

To do this, we create a `build` target that generates the necessary directories using the `-p` option (for `parents`), allowing all required directories (including parent directories) to be created if they do not already exist. If the directories exist, the command will not overwrite them.  

In the prerequisites of the `all` target, we add `build` first to ensure it runs before `make` looks for prerequisite files in `build`.  

Since we are no longer generating all files in the same location, we specify the destination and filename for each `.o` file using the `-o` option. For example, `-o build/objects/main.o` ensures `main.o` is generated in `build/objects/`. Similarly, `-MF build/dependencies/main.d` specifies the dependency file location and its name.  

Now, to clean the project (`make clean`), we simply delete the `build/` directory. The `-rf` option in `rm` combines *recursive* and *force*, allowing directory and subdirectory deletion without confirmation.

We also add `build` to `.PHONY` in case the `build/` directory exists, but not its subdirectories. This could mislead `make`, making it think that `build` is up to date.
:::

8. Run `make`, `make run`, and `make clean` again and observe.

9. Add comments to the makefile (using `#`) to clarify the discussed points.

(ps4-project-organization)=
:::{important} Large project organization
Large projects are organized with multiple makefiles (one at the project root and one per module).
```{code} md
minimal-project/
    source/
        first-module/
            hello.cpp
            hello.h
            makefile
        second-module/
            hi.cpp
            hi.h
            makefile
        main.cpp
    makefile
```
We will explore compilation management in this case in the following bonus section.
:::

### Bonus

:::{important} Bonus
Finish the rest of the session (Exercise 2) first!
:::

The current makefile code contains a lot of redundancies. We can refactor this code using variables as follows:
```{code} makefile
BUILD_DIRECTORY = build
DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/dependencies
OBJECT_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/objects
BINARY_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/binaries

EXECUTABLE = $(BINARY_DIRECTORY)/executable

SOURCE_FILES = $(wildcard *.cpp)

OBJECT_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:.cpp=.o)
OBJECT_FILES := $(OBJECT_FILES:%=$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%)

DEPENDENCY_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:.cpp=.d)
DEPENDENCY_FILES := $(DEPENDENCY_FILES:%=$(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/%)

all: $(BUILD_DIRECTORY) $(EXECUTABLE)

$(BUILD_DIRECTORY):
    mkdir -p $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY) $(OBJECT_DIRECTORY) $(BINARY_DIRECTORY)

$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECT_FILES)
    g++ -o $@ $^

$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%.o: %.cpp
    g++ -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MF $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d

run:
    ./$(EXECUTABLE)

clean:
    rm -rf $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)

.PHONY: all run clean $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)

-include $(DEPENDENCY_FILES)
```

:::{important} Makefile variables
Variables in a makefile are named following the UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention. Their values are accessed using `$(VARIABLE)`.

Here, we have defined variables for different directory names and file types. Let's look at the content of this code:
- `BUILD_DIRECTORY` refers to the directory that will contain our compilation files: here, `build`.
- Within `build`, we organize subdirectories for different file types mentioned earlier. For example, the value of `OBJECT_DIRECTORY` is `build/objects`.
- `EXECUTABLE` allows us to define the name of the executable located in `build/binaries/`. It is important to differentiate between the file name and the file path from the current directory. `$(EXECUTABLE)` will be used to generate the file in the correct location using a path, and it is not just the executable name.
- `SOURCE_FILES` is the list of paths to source files. Here, since these files are located in the same directory as the makefile, we can obtain these paths using the `wildcard *.cpp` command, which returns `main.cpp hello.cpp`. We will reorganize these source files into subdirectories later.
- `OBJECT_FILES` is the list of paths to object files. We obtain this list first with `OBJECT_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:.cpp=.o)`, which iterates over `main.cpp hello.cpp` and replaces the `.cpp` extension with `.o` to get `main.o hello.o`. The instruction `OBJECT_FILES := $(OBJECT_FILES:%=$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%)` iterates over this list `main.o hello.o` and replaces the `%` pattern (e.g., `main.o`) with `$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%`, resulting in `build/objects/main.o`. Thus, `OBJECT_FILES` becomes `build/objects/main.o build/objects/hello.o`. Using `:=` instead of `=` ensures that `make` evaluates the expression only once, preventing infinite loops caused by `OBJECT_FILES` appearing on both sides of the definition.
- The same applies to `DEPENDENCY_FILES`.

The rest of the code is similar to the previous one, with variables replacing hardcoded values:

- `$@` returns the value of the current target.
- `$^` returns the value of the prerequisites.
- `$<` returns the value of the first prerequisite.
- `$*` returns the value of the current `%` pattern.

For example:
```{code} makefile
$(EXECUTABLE): $(OBJECT_FILES)
    g++ -o $@ $^
```
Here, `$@` returns `$(EXECUTABLE)`, which is `build/binaries/executable`, and `$^` returns `$(OBJECT_FILES)`, which is `build/objects/main.o build/objects/hello.o`. Thus, the command `g++ -o $@ $^` becomes `g++ -o build/binaries/executable build/objects/main.o build/objects/hello.o`.

Another example:
```{code} makefile
$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%.o: %.cpp
    g++ -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MF $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d
```
The pattern `$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%.o` defines targets in the form `build/objects/<filename>.o` and repeats the `%` pattern in the prerequisites with `%.cpp`. Thus, `build/objects/main.o` has `main.cpp` as its prerequisite since `%` here corresponds to `main`.  
For the target `build/objects/main.o`, `$<` is `main.cpp`, `$@` is `build/objects/main.o`, and `$(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d` is `build/dependencies/main.d`, since `$*` takes the value of `%`, which is `main`.  
The command `g++ -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MF $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d` becomes `g++ -c main.cpp -o build/objects/main.o -MMD -MF build/dependencies/main.d`, which is the same line of code as before.  
The same logic applies to the target `build/objects/hello.o`.
:::

1. Run `make`, `make run`, and `make clean` again and observe.

:::{warning} The perfect makefile?
We can still go further in refactoring by creating a variable for the compiler `g++`, in case we want to change compilers in the future, or a variable for the compilation options `-c -o -MMD -MF <...>`, which could even vary depending on the context.  
In the future, we could also add targets to generate documentation or for tests.  
But in general, our makefile seems well-suited for an evolving project: it does not need to be modified frequently when we add code to the project.

Unfortunately, that is not the case yet!  
You must have noticed that all the source code files are in the same location. If we have a large project with multiple modules, our makefile will no longer be suitable because, for example, it becomes difficult to manage the `.o` targets, which are all in `build/objects/`, but depend on `.cpp` files from different directories.

Depending on the module, it may also be desirable to compile the project differently or only compile a single module. For example, if other teams are working on the other modules, or if the project is too large to run a full `make` just to test one module.

The best practice here is to have multiple makefiles, one for each module, and a main makefile that will call the makefiles of the different modules.
:::

2. Rearrange your minimal project as follows:
```{code} md
minimal-project/
    source/
        first-module/
            hello.cpp
            hello.h
            makefile
        second-module/
            hi.cpp
            hi.h
            makefile
        main.cpp
    makefile
```

3. In `hi.h`, copy the code from `hello.h` and modify the include guard and the function name to `sayHi`.

4. In `hi.cpp`, copy the code from `hello.cpp` and modify the include directive to include `hi.h`, the function name to `sayHi`, and the console output to `Hi!` instead of `Hello World!`.

5. In `main.cpp`, modify the include directives to include `first-module/hello.h` and `second-module/hi.h` and add `sayHi();` after `sayHello();`.

For this minimal example, we will use the same makefile in both modules, but we can imagine that these makefiles might differ and even be written by different people.

6. Modify the module makefiles as follows:
```{code} makefile
BUILD_DIRECTORY = ../../build
DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/dependencies
OBJECT_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/objects

SOURCE_FILES = $(wildcard *.cpp)

OBJECT_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:.cpp=.o)
OBJECT_FILES := $(OBJECT_FILES:%=$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%)

DEPENDENCY_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:.cpp=.d)
DEPENDENCY_FILES := $(DEPENDENCY_FILES:%=$(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/%)

all: $(BUILD_DIRECTORY) $(OBJECT_FILES)

$(BUILD_DIRECTORY):
	mkdir -p $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY) $(OBJECT_DIRECTORY) $(BINARY_DIRECTORY)

$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%.o: %.cpp
	g++ -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MF $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d

clean:
	rm -rf $(OBJECT_FILES) $(DEPENDENCY_FILES)

.PHONY: all clean $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)

-include $(DEPENDENCY_FILES)
```

:::{important} Module makefile
- The code remains unchanged without generating an executable.
- The `build` directory will be created in the grandparent directory (`../../build`), at the same level as `source`.
- The default target `all` will create the `$(OBJECT_FILES)` instead of the executable.
- The `clean` target deletes only the object and dependency files related to the module.
:::

7. Modify the root project makefile as follows:
```{code} makefile
BUILD_DIRECTORY = build
DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/dependencies
OBJECT_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/objects
BINARY_DIRECTORY = $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)/binaries

SOURCE_DIRECTORY = source

EXECUTABLE = $(BINARY_DIRECTORY)/executable

MODULES = $(wildcard $(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)/*/)
SOURCE_FILES = $(wildcard $(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)/*.cpp)

OBJECT_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:$(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)/%.cpp=%.o)
OBJECT_FILES := $(OBJECT_FILES:%=$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%)

DEPENDENCY_FILES = $(SOURCE_FILES:$(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)/%.cpp=%.d)
DEPENDENCY_FILES := $(DEPENDENCY_FILES:%=$(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/%)

all: $(BUILD_DIRECTORY) $(EXECUTABLE)

$(BUILD_DIRECTORY):
	mkdir -p $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY) $(OBJECT_DIRECTORY) $(BINARY_DIRECTORY)

$(EXECUTABLE): $(MODULES) $(OBJECT_FILES) 
	g++ -o $@ $(wildcard $(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/*.o)

$(MODULES):
	$(MAKE) -C $@

$(OBJECT_DIRECTORY)/%.o: $(SOURCE_DIRECTORY)/%.cpp
	g++ -c $< -o $@ -MMD -MF $(DEPENDENCY_DIRECTORY)/$*.d

run:
	./$(EXECUTABLE)

clean:
	rm -rf $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)

.PHONY: all run clean $(MODULES) $(BUILD_DIRECTORY)

-include $(DEPENDENCY_FILES)
```

:::{important} Root makefile
- We retrieve the source code directory (`source/`).
- Inside `source/`, we retrieve the module names that correspond to subdirectories.
- We also retrieve the `.cpp` source code files. In this example, we only have `main.cpp`, but there could be other files.
- Similar to before, we retrieve the names of object files and the dependency files to generate.
- To create the final executable, we first compile the modules and the object files from the new source code, then link all the object files in `build/objects/`.
- For each module (`source/first-module source/second-module`), we go into the corresponding subdirectory (e.g., `source/first-module`) with the `-C source/first-module` option. Then, we run `make` via the native `$(MAKE)` variable, which inherits the options from the `make` command in our terminal. For example, we can parallelize the compilation when our machine has multiple processors, as source files can be compiled simultaneously. So, `make -j4` uses 4 processors at once, and `$(MAKE)` will take the `-j4` option to compile the modules. For our example, we could replace `$(MAKE)` with `make` directly, but it is better in general to use the native variable associated with the `make` command.  
:::

8. Add comments to the makefiles with `#` to clarify the different blocks of code and add examples for the commands to clarify the syntax.

For example:
```{code} makefile
# Compile source codes to object files
$(TARGET_VARIABLE): $(PREREQUISITE_VARIABLE)
    # For example: g++ -c prerequisite.cpp -o target.o
    g++ -c $< -o $@ 
```

## Exercise 2: Documentation

1. Rewrite your README and check the rendering of the README on GitLab.

:::{note} Reminders
- The main features of this project are to learn good coding and development practices.
- There is no additional documentation.
- You can explain how to clone the repository by creating a PAT (it’s not necessary to be as detailed as in the first TP) and how to compile the code via the command line with `g++` for installation instructions.
- You can explain how to run an executable from the command line for usage instructions.
- You can add an MIT license in a separate file (named `LICENSE`) and include a link to it at the root of the project.  
:::

:::{hint} Some Markdown syntax
:class: dropdown
- `#` creates headings. The more `#`, the smaller the heading.
- `[text](link)` creates hyperlinks.
- ` ``` code ``` ` creates code blocks.
- `**bold text**` makes the text bold.
- `*italic text*` makes the text italic.
- `-` creates bullet points.
- `1.`, `2.`, etc. creates numbered lists.
- `> quote` followed by `> - author` creates a quote with an author.
- `![alternative text](image link)` inserts an image and shows the alternative text when the image fails to load or when we hover over it.
- `- [ ]` creates a checkbox, and `- [x]` a checked box.
- `---` inserts a horizontal line.

2. Create a `documentation/` directory in `PS4/`.

In class, we saw an example of documentation using Doxygen (very similar to Javadoc syntax). Since Doxygen is not (yet) installed on the IUT machines, we will review the same example in Javadoc.

3. Copy the following code into a `Temperature.java` file.

```{code} java

4. Generate the documentation for `Temperature.java` with the command `javadoc -d docs Temperature.java`, which will create a `docs/` directory.

5. View the generated documentation by opening `docs/index.html` in a web browser.

6. Revisit the Doxygen syntax covered in class to write the documentation for the `Product` class from the `short-functions` exercise in `TP3`.

:::{warning} `@example` in Doxygen
:class: dropdown
The `@example` tag in Doxygen should be used in a separate block. Otherwise, Doxygen will treat the entire block as an example and will not show the descriptions in the generated documentation, unlike Javadoc which does not have an `@example` tag.
